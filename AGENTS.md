# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

nx-fhir is an Nx plugin for building FHIR healthcare interoperability projects. It provides generators and executors for creating HAPI FHIR servers (Java/Spring Boot) and TanStack SPA frontends within an Nx monorepo.

## Commands

### Build & Test

```sh
bun install                    # Install dependencies
bun run build                  # Build all packages (nx run-many -t build)
bun run test                   # Run all tests (nx run-many -t test)
bun run e2e                    # Run e2e tests (creates temp workspace, generates server, queries /fhir/metadata)
```

### Single Package Operations

```sh
nx build nx-fhir               # Build the main plugin
nx test nx-fhir                # Run unit tests for nx-fhir
nx lint nx-fhir                # Lint the plugin

# Run a single test file (args after -- pass through to Vitest)
bun nx test nx-fhir -- src/generators/server/server.spec.ts
```

### Local Development

```sh
# Start local npm registry (Verdaccio)
bun nx run @nx-fhir/source:local-registry

# Publish to local registry (in another terminal)
bun nx run-many --nx-bail=false -t unpublish,nx-release-publish -- --registry http://localhost:4873

# Watch and republish on changes
bun nx watch --initialRun --all -- npx nx run-many --nx-bail=false -t unpublish,nx-release-publish -- --registry http://localhost:4873

# Alternative: Link for development
bun run build && cd dist/packages/nx-fhir && bun link && bun install --production
# Then in the consuming Nx workspace:
bun link nx-fhir
```

### E2E Testing with Specific Package Manager

```sh
PACKAGE_MANAGER=npm npm run e2e    # Use npm instead of bun for e2e
```

## Architecture

### Packages

- **`packages/nx-fhir`**: Main Nx plugin with generators, executors, and migrations
- **`packages/create-nx-fhir`**: CLI tool (`npx create-nx-fhir`) to scaffold new workspaces

### Generators (`packages/nx-fhir/src/generators/`)

| Generator              | Purpose                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `server`               | Creates HAPI FHIR JPA server from hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter       |
| `import-server`        | Imports a pre-existing HAPI FHIR server as an Nx project, non-destructively |
| `frontend`             | Scaffolds TanStack Router/Query frontend with Vite (`browser` or `clinical` template) |
| `operation`            | Generates custom FHIR operation stubs from OperationDefinition JSON |
| `implementation-guide` | Adds FHIR IG artifacts to server (alias: `ig`)                      |
| `update-server`        | Updates existing server to newer HAPI version via three-way merge    |
| `update-frontend`      | Updates frontend project to newer template version via three-way merge |
| `update`               | Checks for plugin, server, and frontend updates (runs during `nx migrate`) |
| `preset`               | Used by create-nx-fhir for workspace initialization                 |

### Executors (`packages/nx-fhir/src/executors/`)

- `serve`: Runs Maven spring-boot:run for servers, Vite dev for frontends
- `build`: Runs Maven package or Vite build
- `test`: Runs Maven test or Vitest

### Project Detection (`packages/nx-fhir/src/plugin.ts`)

The plugin auto-detects project types:

- **Server**: Has `pom.xml` + `fhirVersion` in project.json
- **Frontend**: Has `package.json` with `@types/fhir` or `nx-fhir-frontend` tag

The `import-server` generator and the `preset` flow reuse this server fingerprint via `shared/utils/server-detection.ts` to import an already-present HAPI server (writing only `project.json`) instead of scaffolding a new one. The `preset` runs this detection before asking whether to generate a server, so an existing server is imported without prompting. It best-effort correlates the HAPI version from `pom.xml` to a supported starter release and prompts the user to confirm.

### Migrations (`packages/nx-fhir/src/migrations/`)

Two migration systems with three-way merge support:

**HAPI server migrations** (`hapi-server/`):
- `8.2.0-to-8.4.0`
- `8.4.0-to-8.4.0-3`
- `8.4.0-3-to-8.6.0-1`
- `8.6.0-1-to-8.8.0-1`
- `8.8.0-1-to-8.10.0-1`
- `8.10.0-1-to-8.10.0-2`
- `8.10.0-2-to-8.10.0-3`

HAPI migration resolver uses BFS graph traversal to find migration paths between versions.

**Frontend template migrations** (`check-updates/`):
- Triggered during `nx migrate` via the `update` generator
- Downloads old template from the previously installed npm version and new template from the target version
- Performs three-way merge preserving user customizations while applying template updates
- Managed by `frontend-migration.ts` and `frontend-migration-resolver.ts` in shared code

### Shared Code (`packages/nx-fhir/src/shared/`)

- `models/`: TypeScript interfaces for FHIR resources and project config
- `utils/`: Helpers for package manager detection, server YAML updates, Git operations, three-way merge, existing-server detection (`server-detection.ts`)
- `migration/`: Migration resolvers and logic for both HAPI server and frontend template updates
  - `hapi-migration-resolver.ts`: BFS graph traversal for HAPI version upgrade paths
  - `hapi-migration.ts`: Base HAPI migration logic
  - `frontend-migration-resolver.ts`: Resolves frontend template version upgrade paths
  - `frontend-migration.ts`: Three-way merge logic for frontend template updates
- `constants/`: Version constants

## Key Patterns

### Generator Structure

Each generator follows the pattern:

```
generators/{name}/
  ├── {name}.ts          # Main generator function
  ├── {name}.spec.ts     # Unit tests
  ├── schema.json        # Nx schema definition
  ├── schema.d.ts        # TypeScript types for options
  └── files/             # EJS template files (.template extension)
```

### Three-Way Merge for Migrations

Server migrations use `migrateWithThreeWayMerge()` from `shared/utils/merge.ts`:

1. Downloads old HAPI starter release (base)
2. Downloads new HAPI starter release (target)
3. Performs diff3 merge: preserves user changes, applies upstream updates, marks conflicts

### FHIR Version Support

Supports FHIR versions: `STU3`, `R4`, `R4B`, `R5` (see `FhirVersion` enum in `shared/models/index.ts`)

### Server Configuration

Server projects store config in `src/main/resources/application.yaml`. Use `updateServerYaml()` utility to modify.

### Package Manager Support

Only `bun` and `npm` are supported. Use utilities in `shared/utils/package-manager.ts` for package manager abstraction.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Java JDK 17+ (for server projects)
- Maven (for building server projects)
- bun (preferred) or npm

## General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax
